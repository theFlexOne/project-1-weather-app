# Project 1 - Weather App (front-end only)

## Description

This is your basic beginner's weather app. This is the first full project I've built, ever, and is the final project for the first phase of my coding bootcamp course with Flatiron. This version will likely move to a new repo as I expand upon it past being a graded project.

The app is very straightforward both in terms of user experience, and code. It's purpose is to display a detailed weather report of the user's current position, as well as, search for and display the weather of any location.

It uses a combination of OpenWeather's One-Call API, Google's Places API, and Google's Geocoding API to retrieve all the necessary information to display the weather and location accurately.

Although this app is designed for user experience, it's real purpose is to be a springboard for learning JavaScript and a place to practice different concepts. A more polished version will eventually be uploaded that will truly be designed with the user in mind.

## Installation

There's nothing to install. Feel free to fork it and build your own app on top. You will, however, need to supply your own API keys for [OpenWeather's API's](http://www.openweathermap.org/api) and the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

Also, calling the Google Places API will create a "cors" issue. Until this repo is updated, the "cors" issue is up to you to deal with. Two different Chrome extensions that will bypass the cors error, at least while in development, are [Moesif Origin & CORS Changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) & [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf). I'm sure there are others, but those 2 worked for me.

_For my instructors, I can give you my working API keys, just message me in Slack._
